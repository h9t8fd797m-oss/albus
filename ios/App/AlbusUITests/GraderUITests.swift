/// right window; now it proves the more basic thing underneath — that the plan
/// call still returns a shape the client can decode, and that a student who
/// cannot mark is shown a price rather than a broken screen.
///
/// It is still the only test that exercises the real RPC. A unit test on
/// `Allowance` proves the arithmetic; only this proves `my_plan()` still
/// returns what that arithmetic is built on, which is where the last three bugs
/// in this feature lived.
///
/// Nothing here spends a grading. Marking is an Opus call and it is now a paid
/// feature, so a free account is refused before any model runs.
