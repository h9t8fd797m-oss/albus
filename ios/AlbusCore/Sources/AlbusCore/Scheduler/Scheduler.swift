/// 3. **Fixed commitments are walls**, routed around and never through.
/// 4. **Respect declared capacity.** Overfilling a day to make the arithmetic
///    work is how a planner becomes an app people avoid opening.
/// 5. **Deterministic.** Same inputs, same output. Non-determinism reads to a
///    user as the app being broken and makes bugs unreproducible.
