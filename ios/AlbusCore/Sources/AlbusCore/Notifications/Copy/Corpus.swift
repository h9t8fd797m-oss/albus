/// Everything Albus can say, as data.
///
/// Swift arrays rather than a bundled JSON or plist: `AlbusCore` ships no
/// resources today and adding a bundle changes how the package builds, while an
/// array is compile-checked, greppable, and — the reason that actually matters
/// — exhaustively iterable, so a test can prove every reachable cell has
/// something to say and that no joke has leaked into the overdue pool.
///
/// **House rules for anyone adding a line.**
/// - Title at most 40 characters, body at most 110. A truncated punchline is
///   not a punchline.
/// - No exclamation marks. Albus is deadpan; enthusiasm is the other app.
/// - The joke is on Albus or on the situation. Never on the student.
/// - Bold exactly one thing, and make it the thing to do next.
/// - Every `(kind, register)` needs at least two lines with no placeholders, so
///   a moment with thin data can still speak.
