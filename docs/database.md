# Database

14 tables in `public`, in four groups.

## Identity
| Table | Notes |
|---|---|
| `profiles` | 1:1 with `auth.users`, created by trigger. Study window and daily capacity — the scheduler's constraints. |

## The student's work — all owner-scoped
| Table | Notes |
|---|---|
| `courses` | A student's course, optionally linked to a template. |
| `assignments` | Title, deadline, estimated minutes, task type. |
| `subtasks` | The steps a breakdown produced. May cite a rubric criterion. |
| `plan_sessions` | Scheduler output. `is_fixed` marks classes the scheduler routes around. |

## Curriculum — global reference, read-only to clients
| Table | Notes |
|---|---|
| `curricula` | IB_DP, AP, GENERIC |
| `course_templates` | IB History HL, etc. |
| `assessment_types` | IA, Paper 1, EE, DBQ |
| `rubric_criteria` | Criterion name, marks, **our own paraphrased guidance** |
| `syllabus_topics` | Ordered topic list |
| `duration_priors` | Cold-start medians for the local estimator |

## Calibration and commerce
| Table | Notes |
|---|---|
| `completion_logs` | Estimated vs actual. **No free text, ever.** |
| `entitlements` | Subscription tier. Server-written only. |
| `ai_usage` | Per-call model and token counts. Server-written only. |

## Why `completion_logs` looks like that

It mirrors the `/logs` payload exactly: curriculum, course code, task type,
estimated, actual, hour bucket, minutes late, confidence. No title, no notes,
no assignment id that could be joined back to content by anyone with only this
table.

That gives a complete calibration dataset while never recording what a student
is actually working on. Widening this schema later is easy; narrowing it after
launch is not. Don't widen it.

`confidence` is `high` only when a real timer produced the number. Completions
inferred from the session window are `low` and should be weighted down.
