"""Turn fetched logos into the app's asset catalogue.

Separate from fetching on purpose: fetching touches the network and is slow,
this is deterministic and instant. Re-run it after adding or removing a logo by
hand — dropping a better PNG into `logos/` and running this is the whole
workflow for improving one tool's mark.

Anything not in `logos/` simply has no asset, and `ToolIcon` renders no mark at
all rather than inventing one.
