-- Align production's migration bookkeeping with the files in this repo.
--
-- WHAT THIS IS NOT: this applies no DDL. It changes only
-- `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations`, the table the Supabase CLI reads to
-- decide what still needs applying. The schema is already correct — a
-- `supabase db reset --local` rebuilds it from the repo files and the pgTAP
-- suite passes against the result. What is wrong is the record of *which file*
-- produced it.
--
-- WHY IT DRIFTED: every migration from `0030` onward was applied by hand
-- through the dashboard. The dashboard stamps its own timestamp rather than
-- reading the filename, so the recorded version is the moment of application,
-- not the migration's identity. `20260901200000_ib_student_context.sql` was
-- applied without being recorded at all.
--
-- WHY IT MATTERS: `supabase db push` applies every migration whose version it
-- does not recognise. Today it would not recognise thirteen of them, and would
-- replay the entire security hardening against a database that already has it.
-- Until this runs, the `Deploy migrations` workflow's secrets must stay unset.
--
-- HOW TO RUN IT: read it, then execute the whole file in one transaction
-- against production. It is idempotent — running it twice changes nothing the
-- second time — and the verification block at the end raises rather than
-- committing a partial repair.
