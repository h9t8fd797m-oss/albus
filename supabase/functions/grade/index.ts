//
// Mark finished work against the student's own rubric.
//
// The first paid endpoint, and the most expensive call the app makes. Three
// things about it are deliberate:
//
//   * **The paywall is in Postgres.** `check_and_record_ai_usage` resolves the
//     plan, checks the weekly allowance and reserves the slot in one
//     transaction, under a per-user lock. A gate in this file — or on the
//     device — would be one `curl` away from free unlimited marking, and a gate
//     without the lock is one `curl -P` away from it (migration 0036).
//   * **The rubric is loaded by id, never read from the body.** It comes back
//     through the caller's own client, so RLS decides what the id resolves to.
//     A forged id resolves to nothing, not to a stranger's rubric.
//   * **The work is never stored.** Marks, feedback and a character count are
//     written; the essay itself exists only for the length of the request.
