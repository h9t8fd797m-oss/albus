// exists so we never pay Anthropic for a generation we are about to reject.
// The enforcement is a trigger on `public.assignments` (migration 0036), which
// holds whatever path the write arrives by — including the one that skips this
// file entirely by POSTing straight to the table, which is how the cap was
// bypassed before that trigger existed.
