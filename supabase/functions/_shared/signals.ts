//
// The abuse-detection layer's eyes, and the only place raw identifiers exist.
//
// ── What leaves this file ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Two SHA-256 HMACs and nothing else. The IP address and the device identifier
// are read from the request, hashed here, and dropped. Postgres never receives
// either one — not in a column, not in a query log, not in a backup — so the
// correlation the risk model needs exists without the data it would normally
// need to keep.
//
// ── Which device identifier, and why that one ───────────────────────────────
//
// iOS `identifierForVendor`. It is per-vendor rather than per-device, it resets
// when the user deletes every app of ours, and it is not a hardware serial. It
// is the *weakest* identifier that can answer "has this device made five
// accounts this afternoon", which is the correct one to choose. The client is
// free to withhold it and everything still works — the signal is simply absent,
// and an absent signal cannot escalate anything on its own (see 0035).
//
// ── Which part of the IP ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A prefix, never the address: /24 for IPv4 and /48 for IPv6. Two reasons, and
// the second is the important one. It is less identifying — a /24 is up to 254
// households — and it is the right granularity for the question, because
// consumer addresses rotate and mobile carriers hand the same address to
// thousands of people. Scoring the full address would produce a signal that is
// simultaneously more invasive and less useful.
